# Audio_Book_Reader
Main motivation of making this project:
The main motive is for the people who doesn't want to put an eye on screen for a long time which can destroy their eye and it takes long time to read instead of listening. 
It is for those who hate reading or sit and read a PDF file for a long time.

open PyCharm and create a new project along with new enviornment variable.
install a module named "pyttsx3" using "pip install pyttsx3" in the terminal.
install a package named "PyPDF2" using "pip install PyPDF2 " in the teminal.
Drop the PDF file in that project which you want it to dictate.
see the magic after writing the code as given inside my project of "Audio_Book_Reader".
